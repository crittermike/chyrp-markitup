MarkItUp for Chyrp
===================

Connects MarkItUp's Markdown editor to Chyrp's add/edit post interface.

What is MarkItUp?
------------------

MarkItUp is a WYSIWYM (what you see is what you MEAN) editor that can handle multiple types of markup (BBCode, HTML, Markdown, Textile, etc). 

What does this module do?
--------------------------

This module implements the Markdown set of MarkItUp and as such relies on the Markdown Chryp module. It automatically attaches itself to textareas on the add/edit post/page forms.

How do I install it?
----------------------

Just move the top "markitup" folder into Chyrp's modules directory, and then enable it.
